# Where something interesting happens 🏀

Hey there!

FrozenMap comes from two fantastic games full of my memories: The Frozen Throne & Maplestory. 

And this is a blog where something interesting is recorded.

Hope you like it:)

<!--Yet there may be certain differences, for some well known reasons.-->

<!--And one more thing... there is a <a onclick="show('img1')" style="cursor:pointer">Labtocat </a>from [Octodex](https://octodex.github.com)! -->

<!--<img width="128" src="/assets/Labtocat.png" style='display:none' id="img1"/>-->

<!--<script type="text/javascript">
function show(id)
{
	var img = document.getElementById(id);
	if(img.style.display == "none"){
		img.style.display = "block";
	}else{
		img.style.display = "none";
	}
}
</script>-->
