	https://www.newscientist.com/article/2178470-the-us-army-is-making-a-laser-powered-drone-that-can-fly-indefinitely/

	Small flying vehicles with several rotating blades, known as multicopters or drones, have proven valuable to the military for intelligence gathering. But they are incredibly power-hungry, meaning their flying time is limited to half an hour or less.

	Now the US Army is taking wireless recharging to new heights, by using lasers to power small drones in mid-air. So the drones don't have to get down to the ground to get recharged.
